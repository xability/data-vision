    "text": "Hello everyone! I’m [Name], and today we’re continuing our data science journey by exploring data types. In our previous session, we learned about tidy data organization. Now we’ll focus on the different kinds of information that fill those neatly organized tables. Understanding data types is essential for working with data effectively, regardless of which programming language you eventually use.\n\n\n\nEvery piece of information in your dataset has a specific type - just like in the physical world where we have different types of objects like books, cups, and phones. In data science, we categorize information into specific “types” that tell us:\n\nWhat kind of information we’re working with\nWhat operations we can perform on that information\nHow to store and process the information efficiently\n\nThink of data types as containers designed specifically for different kinds of information.\n\n\n\nData types generally fall into two main categories:\n\n\nThese represent quantities and can be used in mathematical operations:\n\nIntegers: Whole numbers without decimal points.\n\nExamples: 1, 42, -7, 0\nUsed for: Counting things, IDs, ages\n\nFloating-Point Numbers: Numbers with decimal points.\n\nExamples: 3.14, -0.5, 98.6\nUsed for: Measurements, percentages, any number that needs precision\n\n\n\n\n\nThese represent qualities, categories, or non-numeric information:\n\nStrings: Text or character data.\n\nExamples: “Hello”, “Jane Smith”, “42 Main Street”\nUsed for: Names, descriptions, addresses, any text information\nNote: Even if a string contains only digits (like “42”), it’s treated as text, not a number\n\nBoolean: True/False values.\n\nExamples: True, False\nUsed for: Yes/No questions, presence/absence, conditions\n\nCategorical/Factors: Values from a limited set of categories.\n\nUnordered (Nominal) Categories: Categories with no natural order\n\nExamples: Colors (Red, Blue, Green), Blood Types (A, B, AB, O), Genre (Fiction, Non-fiction)\nUsed for: Classification without ranking\n\nOrdered (Ordinal) Categories: Categories with a natural hierarchy or sequence\n\nExamples: Education (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD), Rating (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)\nUsed for: Ratings, rankings, levels where order matters but exact distance between values isn’t defined\n\nThe distinction matters because ordered categories allow for operations like “greater than” comparisons\n\n\n\n\n\nThese represent points in time:\n\nDate: Calendar dates.\n\nExamples: “2023-05-15”, “January 1, 2000”\nUsed for: Birthdays, holidays, event dates\n\nTime: Clock times.\n\nExamples: “14:30:00”, “9:45 AM”\nUsed for: Appointment times, duration records\n\nDateTime: Combined date and time.\n\nExamples: “2023-05-15 14:30:00”\nUsed for: Event timestamps, records of when something happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing/NULL: Represents absent or unknown data.\n\nUsed to indicate that a value doesn’t exist or wasn’t recorded\nCan apply to any of the above data types\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s imagine a dataset about library books:\nInteger example: The library has 3 copies of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” - The number 3 is an integer - a whole number with no decimal points.\nFloat example: The book’s user rating is 4.7 out of 5. - 4.7 is a floating-point number because it has a decimal point.\nString example: The author’s name is “Harper Lee.” - “Harper Lee” is a string - a sequence of characters treated as text.\nBoolean example: Is the book currently available? True. - This is a boolean value - either True or False.\nDate example: The book was published on July 11, 1960. - This is a date value, representing a specific day.\nCategorical example: The book’s genre is “Fiction.” - “Fiction” is one value from a limited set of genre categories.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding data types is crucial because:\n\nAppropriate Operations: Different types support different operations.\n\nYou can average ages (numbers) but not names (strings).\nYou can alphabetize names but not add them together.\n\nStorage Efficiency: Proper typing helps store data compactly.\n\nStoring the number 5 as an integer uses less memory than storing it as text “5”.\n\nAnalysis Accuracy: Mistaken types lead to incorrect analysis.\n\nIf ages are accidentally stored as text, calculating the average age won’t work.\n\nData Validation: Types help catch errors.\n\nIf a birth date field contains “apple,” we know there’s an error because “apple” isn’t a valid date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers stored as text:\n\nProblem: “42” (string) vs. 42 (integer)\nImpact: Can’t perform calculations like finding averages\n\nDates stored as text:\n\nProblem: “May 1, 2023” stored as plain text\nImpact: Can’t perform date calculations or sort chronologically\n\nMissing values:\n\nProblem: Empty cells, “N/A”, “NULL”, or other placeholders\nImpact: Can skew calculations or analysis if not handled properly\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about a dataset you might use, such as a personal budget or a list of contacts. What data types would each piece of information be? For example, in a contacts list: - Name would be a string - Age would be an integer - Birthday would be a date - “Has email address?” would be a boolean\nTry verbalizing a few examples of your own, identifying what type each piece of information would be.\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You’ve completed the language-agnostic data science foundations module. You now understand what data science is, how to organize data in a tidy format, and the fundamental data types you’ll work with.\nThank you for your participation and engagement throughout this module. The foundations you’ve built here will serve you well as you continue your data science journey!"

    "text": "Welcome to the module to learn about VS Code. This module will walk you through what VSCode is, how to perform basic programming tasks such as editing, navigating, and debugging code. The tutorial will also equip you with some skils to discover the various features that the programming environment offers.\nBefore we move forward, I would like to offer clarifications of what this tutorial is and is not.\n\n\n\nthe tutorial expects familiarity with programming\nthe tutorial expects you to have screen reader proficiency.\nthe tutorial is designed keeping Windows users in mind. While most concepts would remain the same for the mac, we are unable to guaranty that some of the keyboard shortcuts we will mention work for Mac users as well.\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial is designed for you to follow along. We introduce you to concepts and features of the IDE. After introducing a set of concept or features, we have instructions for you to perform on your own installation of VS Code. These are under the heading Try it yourself.\nWe have also provided screen reader announcements under the basic verbosity setting with punctuation verbosity set to all. You will find these in block quotes.\n\n\n\n\nto become familiar with basic concepts used to refer to the components of the tool.\nto become familiar with editing, debugging, and running code.\nlearn how to learn about the features of the programming environment.\nlearn how to provide feedback to the developers of VS Code.\n\nthis tutorial is NOT an exhaustive list of every feature the IDE offers.\nWith these expectations set, let’s begin our learning journey.\n\n\n\nVisual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft. Microsoft officially refers to VS Code as an editor. It is also the most accessible IDE to the best of our knowledge, is widely used by developers with and without disabilities [cite StackOverflow Developer Survey]. It is designed for building and debugging modern web, AI and cloud applications. VS Code is highly customizable and supports a wide range of programming languages and extensions.\nThe IDE comes built-in with support for a good number of widely used programming languages. If the programming language you use is not supported out of the box, the IDE still probably supports it. the typical process of adding support is as simple as searching for the appropriate extension or extension pack for that language, installing it, and modifying a few config files.\n\n\n\nHere, we will describe a few key components of the IDE and provide a brief definition of what they do.\n\n\n\ntitle bar. This is at the top of the window and typically contains the name of the open file, the workspace, and the status of the file. Screen readers will announce this when you use the read title command (JAWS/NVDA+t) or when switching tabs.\nFile Explorer: Located on the far left, this panel lets you browse, open, and manage files and folders in your project. You can access it by pressing Control+Shift+E.\nEditor: The central area of the screen where you view and edit files. By default, the screen reader focus is placed in the editor when you open a file. Multiple files can be opened in tabs, but the screen reader will focus on one file at a time. You can switch between editors with Control+Tab.\nSide Bar: On the left, this contains views like Search, Source Control, Run & Debug, and Extensions.\nProblems View: Shows errors and warnings in your code. Access it by pressing Control+Shift+M.\nNotifications Area: Displays alerts and messages from VS Code and extensions. Screen readers will announce notifications as they appear.\nOutput Panel: At the bottom, this area shows output from tasks, extensions, and the integrated terminal.\nStatus Bar: At the very bottom, it displays information about your workspace, such as line number, Git branch, and errors.\nActivity Bar: The vertical bar on the far left, used to switch between views like Explorer, Search, Source Control, and Extensions.\nCommand Palette: Accessible via Control+Shift+P, this allows you to quickly run commands and access features. This is the single most useful command, even if you forget a keyboard shortcut.\nPanel: At the bottom, this area shows output, terminal, problems, and debug information. You will navigate to individual components here, although you may not directly navigate to the panel as you use VS Code with a screen reader.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility Help: Press Alt+F1 on any control to open Accessibility Help, which provides information about how to effectively use and navigate that control using a screen reader.\nAccessible View: Provides an accessible reading mode for complex UI elements. This is especially helpful to read long strings of text outputted by VS Code’s chat feature.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, I will describe the UI elements in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.\nStarting from the top, the title bar contains the file name and workspace information. Below that, you’ll find the menu bar (File, Edit, View, etc.) which can be accessed with Alt+F to open the File menu, Alt+E for Edit menu, and so on. You will not be relying on these menues as much as treiditional applications when using VS Code.\nMoving down the left side, the Activity Bar is positioned vertically and contains icons for switching between different views. Each activity has a keyboard shortcut: Explorer (Ctrl+Shift+E), Search (Ctrl+Shift+F), Source Control (Ctrl+Shift+G), Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D), and Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X).\nThe Side Bar appears to the right of the Activity Bar and displays the content for the currently selected activity. For example, when Explorer is selected, the Side Bar shows your project’s file and folder structure in a tree view. When using a screen reader, you will primarily navigate the activity and side bars using keyboard shortcuts.\nThe center area is dominated by the Editor, where you write and edit your code. Multiple files can be open simultaneously in tabs across the top of the editor. You can navigate between open files using Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown.\nAt the bottom of the screen, you’ll find the Status Bar, which displays contextual information such as the current line and column number, file encoding, language mode, and Git branch information.\nFinally, the Panel area at the bottom can contain various views including the integrated Terminal, Output, Problems, and Debug Console. You can toggle the panel visibility with Ctrl+J and cycle through panel views using Ctrl+Shift+Y for Debug Console, Ctrl+Shift+U for Output, and Ctrl+Shift+M for Problems.\n\n\n\nVS Code is an electron application, just like slack. This means that the best way to interact with VS Code is with your virtual PC cursor turned off ( if you are using JAWS), in focus mode (if you are using NVDA), or with quick nav off (if you are using VoiceOver).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall VS Code from the official download page.\nFollow the instalation steps. This should be relatively straightforward. Please attend office hours if you are stuck here.\n\n\n\n\n\ngo to a folder containing some plain text files or code files.

It is designed for building and debugging modern web, AI and cloud applications. VS Code is highly customizable and supports a wide range of programming languages and extensions.\nThe IDE comes built-in with support for a good number of widely used programming languages. If the programming language you use is not supported out of the box, the IDE still probably supports it. the typical process of adding support is as simple as searching for the appropriate extension or extension pack for that language, installing it, and modifying a few config files."

Screen readers will announce notifications as they appear.\nOutput Panel: At the bottom, this area shows output from tasks, extensions, and the integrated terminal.\nStatus Bar: At the very bottom, it displays information about your workspace, such as line number, Git branch, and errors.\nActivity Bar: The vertical bar on the far left, used to switch between views like Explorer, Search, Source Control, and Extensions.\nCommand Palette: Accessible via Control+Shift+P, this allows you to quickly run commands and access features. This is the single most useful command, even if you forget a keyboard shortcut.\nPanel: At the bottom, this area shows output, terminal, problems, and debug information. You will navigate to individual components here, although you may not directly navigate to the panel as you use VS Code with a screen reader.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility Help: Press Alt+F1 on any control to open Accessibility Help, which provides information about how to effectively use and navigate that control using a screen reader.\nAccessible View: Provides an accessible reading mode for complex UI elements. This is especially helpful to read long strings of text outputted by VS Code’s chat feature."

    "text": "In this chapter, we will read and write code using a screen reader with VS Code. The first step to do this is to setup python on your computer and configure VS Code to use the right python interpreter.\nNote that the basics of python and its installation on to your computer are out of scope for this tutorial. Please refer to information online to install python on your computer. The following steps assume that you have a working version of Python on your computer.\nVS Code offers support for various programming languages through extensions. To work with Python, you will need to download the Python extension. Please follow the steps listed below to install the Python extension in your IDE. 1. Open the command pallet and select the\nExtensions: Install Extensions\ncommand. 2. You will be placed in a search box where you can search for extensions. 3. start typing “python”. Your screen reader should announce the number of extensions that match your search term. 4. press tab to go to the list of extensions. This is a vertical list view with information about the extension’s name, the developer of that extension, whether the developer is verified, and a short description of that extension. For python, the screen reader would make an announcement similar to: &gt; Python, 2025.8.0, Verified Publisher Microsoft, Python language support with extension access points for IntelliSense (Pylance), Debugging (Python Debugger), linting, formatting, refactoring, unit tests, and more. , Rated 4.19 out of 5 stars by 617 users 2 of 1970 5. press enter. You will now be taken to a page with the extension’s description. The virtual cursor of your screen reader automatically gets activated in this view. You can explore information about the extension using standard web browsing commands. 6. When you are done reading the information, turn off the virtual cursor (JAWS) or switch back to focus mode (NVDA). 7. close the extension view by pressing control+w. 8. Currently, there are focus issues to get to the install button. A work-around semes to be to repeat steps 1 through 5. 9. Press tab once you are on the python extension. 10. Press tab until you get to a toolbar that has a button to “install extension”. If the extension is already installed, you will see a “manage” button. 11. Press the install button. You will again be directed to the extension’s readme page. Press control plus w to close the readme. 12. VSCode currently does not provide an alert when an extension is installed. To make sure the extension is installed and running, restart VSCode.\n\n\n\nPick a task you usually perform using the terminal or other user interfaces that is related to programming.

    "text": "Hello everyone! Today we’re starting our journey into data visualization with one of the most common and versatile chart types: the bar plot. Before we learn how to create these using programming, let’s understand what they are and how to interpret them.\n\n\n\nA bar plot (or bar chart) represents data using rectangular bars where: - The length (or height) of each bar represents a value - Each bar typically represents a different category - Bars can be vertical (standing up) or horizontal (lying down) - The space between bars helps distinguish different categories\nThink of it like building blocks stacked to different heights, where each stack represents a number for a specific category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShows a single value for each category\nExample: Number of students in different grades\n\nGrade 1: 25 students (one bar)\nGrade 2: 30 students (one bar)\nGrade 3: 28 students (one bar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShows multiple values for each category\nExample: Number of students by gender in each grade\n\nGrade 1: 12 boys, 13 girls (two bars)\nGrade 2: 14 boys, 16 girls (two bars)\nGrade 3: 15 boys, 13 girls (two bars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShows parts of a whole for each category\nExample: Student performance levels in each grade\n\nGrade 1: 10 Advanced + 8 Proficient + 7 Basic (one bar divided into three sections)\nGrade 2: 12 Advanced + 10 Proficient + 8 Basic\nGrade 3: 8 Advanced + 12 Proficient + 8 Basic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar plots are best for: 1. Comparing quantities across categories 2. Showing distribution of data across groups 3. Displaying part-to-whole relationships (stacked bars) 4. Highlighting differences between groups\n\n\n\nLet’s explore a simple bar plot about book genres in a library:\nData Description: - Fiction: 500 books (tallest bar) - Non-fiction: 300 books (medium bar) - Children’s: 400 books (second tallest bar) - Reference: 100 books (shortest bar)\nKey Features to Notice: 1. Each genre is a separate bar 2. Height corresponds to number of books 3. Bars are evenly spaced 4. Each bar has a label (genre name) 5. Numbers increase from bottom to top\n\n\n\nWhen working with bar plots: 1. Color alone should never be the only way to distinguish bars 2. Patterns or textures can help differentiate bars 3. Clear labels are essential 4. A proper title explains what the plot shows 5. Scale should start at zero to avoid misrepresentation\n\n\n\n\nTruncated Axes: Starting y-axis above zero can exaggerate differences\nToo Many Categories: Too many bars make the plot hard to understand\nUnclear Labels: Vague or missing labels make interpretation impossible\nMissing Context: Not providing units or time period\nPoor Ordering: Random category order when a logical order exists\n\n\n\n\nThink about data you encounter in daily life that could be shown in a bar plot: - Monthly expenses by category - Time spent on different activities - Items in your grocery list by quantity\nFor example, describe how you would represent the number of times you ate different fruits last week: - Apples: 5 times - Bananas: 3 times - Oranges: 4 times\nHow would you arrange these bars? What would you label them?\n\n\n\nThis understanding of bar plots forms the foundation for: 1. Creating plots in programming languages 2. Making informed decisions about data visualization 3. Interpreting graphs in research and media 4. Communicating data findings effectively\nThank you for joining today’s session. Remember: a well-designed bar plot tells a clear story about your data!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hello again! I’m [Name], and today we’ll explore a key idea in data science called “tidy data.” Understanding tidy data will make your future work with data much easier and less confusing.\n\n\n\nImagine you’re working with a messy desk—papers are everywhere, and it’s hard to find what you need. Messy data is just like that: it’s hard to work with, and mistakes are easy to make. Tidy data is like having everything organized in neat folders, so you can quickly find and use the information you need.\n\n\n\nTidy data follows three simple rules: 1. Each variable forms a column.\n- A variable is something you measure or record, like “age” or “score.” 2. Each observation forms a row.\n- An observation is one item or event, like one person’s test results. 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.\n- If you have different things, like students and their test scores, you keep each type in its own table.\n\n\n\nLet’s look at student test score data in both messy and tidy formats.\nMessy Data Example:\n\n\n\nRow\nInformation\n\n\n\n\n1\nAlice, Math: 90, Reading: 85\n\n\n2\nBen got an 80 in Math and Reading score: 88\n\n\n3\nCarla - Math 95, Read. 92\n\n\n\nThis data is messy because: - Each row has a different format - Variables aren’t in consistent columns - Information is mixed together and inconsistently labeled\nTidy Data Example:\n\n\n\nName\nSubject\nScore\n\n\n\n\nAlice\nMath\n90\n\n\nAlice\nReading\n85\n\n\nBen\nMath\n80\n\n\nBen\nReading\n88\n\n\nCarla\nMath\n95\n\n\nCarla\nReading\n92\n\n\n\nThis data is tidy because: - Each variable (Name, Subject, Score) has its own column - Each row is one observation (one student’s score in one subject) - The data is consistent and clearly organized\n\n\n\nTidy data (sometimes called “panel data”) is best understood by thinking about how data is organized in a program like Excel:\nExcel Structure: - A table is the entire grid of data. In Excel, this is your spreadsheet. - A row runs horizontally from left to right, labeled with numbers (1, 2, 3…). - A column runs vertically from top to bottom, labeled with letters (A, B, C…). - A cell is where a row and column intersect (like cell B3). - A column header is typically the first row of your table, containing labels that describe what information is in each column (like “Name”, “Age”, “Score”). - A row header is sometimes the first column, used to identify each record (like an ID number or name).\nTidy Data in Excel Terms: 1. Each variable forms a column - In Excel, each letter-labeled column would contain just one type of information, with a clear column header describing that variable. 2. Each observation forms a row - In Excel, each numbered row would represent one complete record, sometimes with a row header identifying that specific observation. 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table - Different types of related data would be in separate Excel worksheets.\nWhy This Organization Matters: - Easier sorting (click column headers in Excel) - Simpler filtering (use Excel’s filter buttons) - Consistent structure for analysis tools - Clearer pattern recognition - Foundation for more advanced data operations\n\n\n\nThink about a list of your favorite books. How would you organize information about each book—like title, author, and year published—so that each row is one book and each column is one piece of information? Try describing your tidy table out loud or writing it down.\n\n\n\nIn the next lesson, we’ll learn about different data types—like numbers, text, and dates—and why they matter when working with tidy data.\nThank you for joining today’s session. Keep practicing organizing information—you’re building a strong foundation for your data science journey!"

    "text": "Tidy data (sometimes called “panel data”) is best understood by thinking about how data is organized in a program like Excel:\nExcel Structure: - A table is the entire grid of data. In Excel, this is your spreadsheet. - A row runs horizontally from left to right, labeled with numbers (1, 2, 3…). - A column runs vertically from top to bottom, labeled with letters (A, B, C…). - A cell is where a row and column intersect (like cell B3). - A column header is typically the first row of your table, containing labels that describe what information is in each column (like “Name”, “Age”, “Score”). - A row header is sometimes the first column, used to identify each record (like an ID number or name).\nTidy Data in Excel Terms: 1. Each variable forms a column - In Excel, each letter-labeled column would contain just one type of information, with a clear column header describing that variable. 2. Each observation forms a row - In Excel, each numbered row would represent one complete record, sometimes with a row header identifying that specific observation. 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table - Different types of related data would be in separate Excel worksheets.\nWhy This Organization Matters: - Easier sorting (click column headers in Excel) - Simpler filtering (use Excel’s filter buttons) - Consistent structure for analysis tools - Clearer pattern recognition - Foundation for more advanced data operations"

    "text": "Hello and welcome to our data science bootcamp! I’m your instructor, [Name]. Today, we’re starting our journey into the world of data together. Data science is like having a special toolkit that helps us turn information—such as numbers, words, or lists—into clear answers to questions about the world around us. You don’t need to know any programming yet; today, we’ll focus on understanding the main ideas and how data science can help us solve real problems.\n\n\n\nAt its core, data science brings together three things: 1. Data: any collection of facts, such as customer records, sensor readings, or survey responses. 2. Science: a systematic, repeatable approach—much like following a recipe in a kitchen. 3. Insights: the meaningful answers or patterns we uncover.\nFor example, imagine you ask, “Which product sold most last month?” The data might be a simple table of sales transactions. Following scientific steps, you clean and analyze that table, and your insight could be: “Product X was our bestseller.” That insight helps guide business decisions.\n\n\n\nData science projects often follow a clear, systematic flow:\nStep 1: Import Data\n• Bring raw data into your workspace from files, databases, or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces, which are ways to request data from online services).\nStep 2: Tidy Data\n• Structure your data so each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of unit is in its own table.\nStep 3: Transform & Explore\n• Filter, summarize, and visualize the data to detect patterns and check assumptions.\nStep 4: Model Data\n• Apply statistical methods or predictive techniques to answer your question.\nStep 5: Communicate Results\n• Share your insights with clear explanations, tables, and visual descriptions.\n\n\n\nLet’s use our workflow to answer a simple question: “How long do people spend on our website?”\nImagine we have a list of four people who visited our website yesterday. For each person, we know how many seconds they spent on the site. Here are the times: - The first person spent 2 minutes (which is 120 seconds). - The second person spent 5 minutes (which is 300 seconds). - The third person spent 3 minutes (which is 180 seconds). - The fourth person spent 4 minutes (which is 240 seconds).\nLet’s walk through the steps:\nStep 1: Import Data\n• Our data is the four session times: 120, 300, 180, and 240 seconds.\nStep 2: Tidy Data\n• Each session time is listed separately, with no missing or extra information. The data is tidy.\nStep 3: Transform & Explore\n• We check that all times are positive numbers and there are no mistakes. • Next, we add up all the times: 120 plus 300 plus 180 plus 240 equals 840 seconds in total. • There are 4 people in our list.\nStep 4: Model Data\n• To find the average, we divide the total time by the number of people: 840 divided by 4 equals 210 seconds.\nStep 5: Communicate Results\n• We can say: “On average, each person spent 210 seconds on the website.” • To make it even clearer, 210 seconds is the same as 3 minutes and 30 seconds.\nThis example shows how we start with a simple question and use data, step by step, to find a clear answer.\n\n\n\nNow it’s your turn: think of one question you find interesting. What data would you need to answer it? Take a moment to type or speak your question in the discussion board. Exploring different questions builds your curiosity—a key skill in data science.\n\n\n\n\nIn our next lecture, we’ll learn conceptually what “tidy data” is, why it matters, and how it sets the stage for smooth analysis—no code required yet.\n\nThank you for joining today’s session. I look forward to seeing your questions and continuing our journey into data science!"
