# What is Data Science?

## 1. Welcome
Hello and welcome to our data science bootcamp! I’m your instructor, [Name]. Today, we’re starting our journey into the world of data together. Data science is like having a special toolkit that helps us turn information—such as numbers, words, or lists—into clear answers to questions about the world around us. You don’t need to know any programming yet; today, we’ll focus on understanding the main ideas and how data science can help us solve real problems.

## 2. What Is Data Science?
At its core, data science brings together three things:
1. Data: any collection of facts, such as customer records, sensor readings, or survey responses.
2. Science: a systematic, repeatable approach—much like following a recipe in a kitchen.
3. Insights: the meaningful answers or patterns we uncover.

For example, imagine you ask, “Which product sold most last month?” The data might be a simple table of sales transactions. Following scientific steps, you clean and analyze that table, and your insight could be: “Product X was our bestseller.” That insight helps guide business decisions.

## 3. Data Science Workflow
Data science projects often follow a clear, systematic flow:

Step 1: Import Data  
  • Bring raw data into your workspace from files, databases, or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces, which are ways to request data from online services).

Step 2: Tidy Data  
  • Structure your data so each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of unit is in its own table.

Step 3: Transform & Explore  
  • Filter, summarize, and visualize the data to detect patterns and check assumptions.

Step 4: Model Data  
  • Apply statistical methods or predictive techniques to answer your question.

Step 5: Communicate Results  
  • Share your insights with clear explanations, tables, and visual descriptions.

## 4. Concrete Example
Let’s use our workflow to answer a simple question: “How long do people spend on our website?”

Imagine we have a list of four people who visited our website yesterday. For each person, we know how many seconds they spent on the site. Here are the times:
- The first person spent 2 minutes (which is 120 seconds).
- The second person spent 5 minutes (which is 300 seconds).
- The third person spent 3 minutes (which is 180 seconds).
- The fourth person spent 4 minutes (which is 240 seconds).

Let’s walk through the steps:

Step 1: Import Data  
  • Our data is the four session times: 120, 300, 180, and 240 seconds.

Step 2: Tidy Data  
  • Each session time is listed separately, with no missing or extra information. The data is tidy.

Step 3: Transform & Explore  
  • We check that all times are positive numbers and there are no mistakes.
  • Next, we add up all the times: 120 plus 300 plus 180 plus 240 equals 840 seconds in total.
  • There are 4 people in our list.

Step 4: Model Data  
  • To find the average, we divide the total time by the number of people: 840 divided by 4 equals 210 seconds.

Step 5: Communicate Results  
  • We can say: “On average, each person spent 210 seconds on the website.”
  • To make it even clearer, 210 seconds is the same as 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

This example shows how we start with a simple question and use data, step by step, to find a clear answer.

## 5. Reflection and Exploration
Now it’s your turn: think of one question you find interesting. What data would you need to answer it? Take a moment to type or speak your question in the discussion board. Exploring different questions builds your curiosity—a key skill in data science.

## 6. Next Steps
- In our next lecture, we’ll learn conceptually what “tidy data” is, why it matters, and how it sets the stage for smooth analysis—no code required yet.

Thank you for joining today’s session. I look forward to seeing your questions and continuing our journey into data science!
