# Understanding Heat Maps

## 1. Welcome
Hello everyone! Today we're exploring heat maps - a visualization that uses color intensity or patterns to show relationships between two categorical variables. For our blind and low-vision learners, we'll focus on understanding the structure and interpretation of heat maps through clear verbal descriptions.

## 2. What is a Heat Map?
A heat map is like a grid or table where:
- Rows represent one category
- Columns represent another category
- Each cell shows a value through color intensity or pattern
- Higher values typically have stronger intensity
- Lower values typically have lighter intensity

Think of it like a temperature grid of a room, where each square represents how warm or cool that spot is.

## 3. Structure of a Heat Map

1. **Grid Layout**:
   - Rows and columns form a matrix
   - Each cell represents an intersection
   - Labels on both axes identify categories

2. **Values Representation**:
   - Numerical values in each cell
   - Color intensity shows magnitude
   - Patterns can replace colors for accessibility

## 4. Verbal Example: Weekly Activity Schedule

Let's explore a student's weekly activity levels across different times:

Days (Rows):
- Monday through Friday

Time Slots (Columns):
- Morning (8-12)
- Afternoon (12-4)
- Evening (4-8)

Activity Levels (Cell Values):
- High: 8-10 hours (intense)
- Medium: 4-7 hours (moderate)
- Low: 0-3 hours (light)

Sample Description:
"Monday morning shows high activity (9 hours),
Monday afternoon is moderate (5 hours),
Monday evening is light (2 hours)..."

## 5. Common Applications

1. **Time-Based Patterns**:
   - Weekly schedules
   - Monthly activities
   - Seasonal variations

2. **Correlation Matrices**:
   - Relationship strength between variables
   - Pattern identification
   - Cluster analysis

3. **Geographic Data**:
   - Population density
   - Weather patterns
   - Economic indicators

## 6. Reading a Heat Map

Step-by-Step Approach:
1. Identify row categories
2. Identify column categories
3. Understand the value scale
4. Read cell values systematically
5. Look for patterns:
   - Clusters of high values
   - Clusters of low values
   - Gradients or transitions

## 7. Accessibility Considerations

1. **Alternative Representations**:
   - Numerical tables
   - Textual descriptions
   - Pattern-based encoding

2. **Clear Labeling**:
   - Row headers
   - Column headers
   - Value scales
   - Units of measurement

3. **Pattern Description**:
   - Systematic cell-by-cell reading
   - Highlight important clusters
   - Note significant patterns

## 8. Common Patterns to Listen For

1. **Clusters**:
   - Groups of similar values
   - Hot spots (high values)
   - Cold spots (low values)

2. **Gradients**:
   - Smooth transitions
   - Value progression
   - Directional changes

3. **Outliers**:
   - Unexpected high values
   - Unexpected low values
   - Irregular patterns

## 9. Common Pitfalls

1. **Too Many Categories**:
   - Overwhelming detail
   - Hard to navigate
   - Difficult to remember

2. **Poor Scale Choice**:
   - Insufficient value distinction
   - Unclear boundaries
   - Misleading patterns

3. **Missing Context**:
   - Undefined units
   - Unclear categories
   - Unexplained patterns

## 10. Reflection and Exploration
Think about data that could be shown in a heat map:
- Your daily schedule
- Monthly expenses by category
- Activity levels throughout the day

Create a simple 3x3 grid describing:
- Morning/Afternoon/Evening
- High/Medium/Low activity
- Pattern descriptions

Thank you for today's session! Remember: heat maps help us see patterns in two-dimensional categorical data through systematic organization and value representation.
