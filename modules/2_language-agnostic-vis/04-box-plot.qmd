# Understanding Box Plots

## 1. Welcome
Hello everyone! Today we're learning about box plots, also called box-and-whisker plots. These powerful visualizations help us understand how numerical data is spread out and where most of our values lie.

## 2. What is a Box Plot?
A box plot summarizes data using five key numbers:
1. Minimum value (bottom whisker)
2. First quartile (bottom of box)
3. Median (middle line in box)
4. Third quartile (top of box)
5. Maximum value (top whisker)

Think of it like dividing your data into four equal parts, then drawing a box with "whiskers" to show its spread.

## 3. Components of a Box Plot

### The Box
- **Bottom of Box**: First quartile (Q1)
  - 25% of data falls below this point
- **Line in Middle**: Median
  - 50% of data falls below this point
- **Top of Box**: Third quartile (Q3)
  - 75% of data falls below this point
- **Box Height**: Interquartile range (IQR)
  - Shows where middle 50% of data lies

### The Whiskers
- **Bottom Whisker**: Extends to minimum value
- **Top Whisker**: Extends to maximum value
- **Whisker Length**: Shows spread of non-outlier data

### Outliers
- Points beyond whiskers
- Individual dots above or below whiskers
- Unusually high or low values

## 4. Verbal Example: Test Scores

Let's explore test scores from 0 to 100:
- Minimum: 45 (bottom whisker)
- Q1: 65 (bottom of box)
- Median: 75 (middle line)
- Q3: 85 (top of box)
- Maximum: 95 (top whisker)

What This Tells Us:
1. Middle 50% of scores fall between 65 and 85
2. Typical score is 75 (median)
3. Spread is fairly symmetric (similar distance above/below median)
4. No extreme outliers in this case

## 5. When to Use Box Plots

Best for:
1. Comparing distributions between groups
2. Identifying outliers
3. Showing data spread
4. Comparing multiple datasets side by side

## 6. Multiple Box Plots

Example: Compare test scores across three classes:

Class A:
- Box: 65-85 (median 75)
- Whiskers: 45-95

Class B:
- Box: 70-90 (median 80)
- Whiskers: 55-98

Class C:
- Box: 60-80 (median 70)
- Whiskers: 40-90

This shows us:
1. Class B has highest typical scores
2. Class C has lowest typical scores
3. All classes have similar spread

## 7. Accessibility Considerations

1. **Clear Description**:
   - State all five numbers
   - Describe overall shape
   - Mention any outliers

2. **Alternative Text**:
   - Include key statistics
   - Describe relative positions
   - Note important patterns

3. **Data Access**:
   - Provide numerical summaries
   - Include table format
   - List outliers separately

## 8. Common Patterns

1. **Symmetric Distribution**:
   - Equal whisker lengths
   - Median in middle of box

2. **Skewed Distribution**:
   - Unequal whisker lengths
   - Median closer to one end

3. **Outliers Present**:
   - Points beyond whiskers
   - Individual markers

## 9. Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing Context**:
   - Not stating units
   - Unclear scale
   - Undefined outlier criteria

2. **Poor Comparison**:
   - Different scales
   - Misaligned boxes
   - Inconsistent widths

## 10. Reflection and Exploration

Think about numerical data you encounter:
- Monthly expenses
- Daily temperatures
- Exercise duration

Questions to consider:
- What's the typical value?
- How spread out are the values?
- Are there any unusual values?

Thank you for today's session! Remember: box plots help us understand the spread and center of our data in one clear picture.
